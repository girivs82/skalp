## Phase 4: GPU-Native Simulation (Weeks 13-16) - MOVED UP!

**Critical Design Decision**: We build GPU-native from the start. No throwaway CPU simulation code.

### Why GPU-First is Non-Negotiable:
- Our entire architecture assumes GPU parallelism (combinational cone extraction)
- CPU simulation would require event queues (which we explicitly don't want)

## Development Priorities

### Critical Path (Must Have for MVP):
1. Basic parser and type system (Phase 1)
2. Entities and basic logic (Phase 2)
3. SystemVerilog codegen (Phase 2.4)
4. Clock domains (Phase 3.1)
5. **GPU-native simulation (Phase 4)** - Build right from the start!

### High Priority (Version 1.0):
1. Protocols (Phase 3.3)
2. Intent system (Phase 4.4)
3. Optimization passes (Phase 5.2)
4. Assertions (Phase 6.1)
5. Requirements (Phase 6.3)

### Medium Priority (Version 1.5):
1. Safety features (Phase 7)
2. FPGA support (Phase 9.1)
3. LSP (Phase 10.1)
4. Performance optimizations

### Future (Version 2.0+):
1. Photonic support
2. Advanced formal verification
3. Machine learning optimizations
4. Cloud compilation service

## Resource Allocation

### Team Structure (Ideal):
- **Core Compiler**: 2-3 developers
- **Simulation**: 1-2 developers
- **Backends**: 1-2 developers
- **Safety/Verification**: 1 developer
- **Tooling/LSP**: 1 developer

### Solo Development Strategy:
If developing solo, focus on:
1. Vertical slice first (parser â†’ codegen for simple designs)
2. Iterate on features (add one feature through all layers)
3. Prioritize user-visible functionality
4. Defer optimizations until core works

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
- Each module has comprehensive unit tests
- Property-based testing for parser
- Snapshot testing for codegen

### Integration Tests:
- End-to-end compilation tests
- Simulation vs reference comparison
- Multi-file projects
- Real-world designs

### Validation:
- Compile known designs (RISC-V cores, etc.)
- Compare with hand-written HDL
- Formal equivalence checking
- Silicon validation (long-term)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
1. **Parser Complexity**: Use parser generator initially, hand-write later
2. **Type System Complexity**: Start simple, add features incrementally
3. **GPU Simulation**: Fall back to CPU simulation initially
4. **CDC Analysis**: Leverage existing algorithms, cite papers

### Schedule Risks:
1. **Scope Creep**: Strict MVP definition, defer features
2. **Integration Issues**: Continuous integration from day 1
3. **Performance**: Profile early, optimize later
4. **Compatibility**: Target SystemVerilog-2017 subset first

- Can parse and generate SystemVerilog for simple counters
- Basic type checking works
- Hierarchical designs compile

### Phase 3-4 Success:
- Clock domain safety demonstrated

## Implementation Notes

- **Testing**: `cargo test` + `proptest`

### Code Organization:

## Next Steps

1. **Review and refine this plan**
2. **Set up development environment**
3. **Create project skeleton**
4. **Implement Phase 1.1 (Project Setup)**
5. **Begin Phase 1.2 (Lexer)**

## Questions to Resolve

1. Should we support Verilog import for gradual migration?
2. Should we target LLVM-IR for software simulation?
3. Should we implement our own place & route or use existing tools?
4. Should we support Python bindings for scripting?
5. How much SystemVerilog compatibility do we need?
