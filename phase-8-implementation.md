## ðŸ“‹ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

**LIR Structure Example:**
```rust
pub struct LirGate {
    pub id: GateId,
    pub gate_type: GateType,
    pub inputs: Vec<NetId>,
    pub outputs: Vec<NetId>,
    pub timing: GateTiming,
    pub area: f32,
}

pub enum GateType {
    And, Or, Not, Nand, Nor, Xor,
    Mux, FlipFlop, Latch,
    TechSpecific(String), // For technology-specific gates
}
```

**Optimization Pass Framework:**
```rust
pub trait OptimizationPass {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn run(&self, lir: &mut Lir) -> OptimizationResult;
    fn should_run(&self, lir: &Lir) -> bool;
}
```

**Timing Analysis Integration:**
```rust
pub struct TimingResult {
    pub critical_paths: Vec<CriticalPath>,
    pub slack: HashMap<NetId, f32>,
    pub clock_skew: HashMap<ClockId, f32>,
    pub violations: Vec<TimingViolation>,
}
```
