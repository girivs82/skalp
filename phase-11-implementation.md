## 📊 CURRENT STATUS

**Foundation Complete:** ✅ All core language features implemented
- Phases 1-10: Complete language, simulation, synthesis, verification, safety, and backends
- GPU simulation: Fully functional with Metal shaders
- ASIC/FPGA backends: Complete infrastructure for real hardware

**Focus:** ❌ User experience and production readiness
- LSP server development needed
- Documentation and tutorials missing
- Standard library components need implementation
- Performance optimization required
