## 📋 Detailed Tasks

### 1. **Regression Test Suite** (Critical)

The codebase is large and complex - we need comprehensive regression tests to ensure fixes don't break other components.

#### 1.1 Frontend Tests
- [ ] **Lexer regression tests**
  - All token types
  - Edge cases (comments, whitespace, string escaping)
  - Error conditions

- [ ] **Parser regression tests**
  - All expression types (binary, unary, index, range)
  - Nested expressions (including the complex cases we just fixed)
  - All statement types
  - All declaration types
  - Error recovery

- [ ] **HIR builder regression tests**
  - Expression building for all types
  - Pattern matching (literals, wildcards, paths)
  - If-expressions and else-if chains
  - Match expressions with complex arms
  - Index and range expressions

- [ ] **Type checking regression tests**
  - Basic types (bit, int, bool)
  - Composite types (structs, enums)
  - Generic types and trait bounds
  - Type inference
  - Error cases

#### 1.2 MIR Tests
- [ ] **HIR to MIR transformation**
  - Signal assignments
  - Event handlers
  - State machines
  - Clock domains

- [ ] **MIR optimization passes**
  - Dead code elimination
  - Constant propagation
  - Common subexpression elimination
  - Validation that optimizations preserve semantics

#### 1.3 Backend Tests
- [ ] **SystemVerilog codegen regression**
  - All expression types generate correct Verilog
  - Module structure and ports
  - Always blocks (combinational and sequential)
  - Wire declarations
  - Complex nested expressions (like ALU overflow)

- [ ] **GPU simulation regression**
  - Metal shader generation
  - Simulation correctness
  - Performance baselines

- [ ] **FPGA synthesis regression**
  - Target-specific optimizations
  - Resource utilization
  - Timing constraints

- [ ] **ASIC backend regression**
  - Standard cell mapping
  - Timing analysis
  - Power optimization

#### 1.4 End-to-End Tests
- [ ] **Example projects compilation**
  - ALU (all operations, overflow detection)
  - Counter (with wraparound)
  - FIFO (with full/empty signals)
  - UART (transmit/receive)
  - AXI4-Lite interface

- [ ] **Standard library tests**
  - Each stdlib component compiles
  - Each component simulates correctly
  - Verification properties pass

- [ ] **Integration tests**
  - Complete pipeline: parse → HIR → MIR → codegen → simulate
  - Error propagation through pipeline
  - Multi-file projects

### 2. **Test Infrastructure** (Critical)

  - Integration tests (component interactions)
  - End-to-end tests (full pipeline)
  - Performance benchmarks

- [ ] **Test utilities**
  - Helper functions for common test patterns
  - Assertion macros for HIR/MIR comparison
  - Test data builders

- [ ] **Coverage tracking**
  - Code coverage measurement
  - Feature coverage matrix
  - Gap analysis and reporting

#### 2.2 Test Organization
- [ ] **Reorganize existing tests**
  - Group by component/feature
  - Clear naming conventions
  - Documentation for test purpose

- [ ] **Test data management**
  - Centralized test fixtures
  - Shared test SKALP files
  - Version control for test assets

### 3. **LSP Debugging** (High)

- [ ] **Message protocol debugging**
  - Fix message parsing issues noted in Phase 11
  - Test with real VSCode extension
  - Validate all LSP capabilities

- [ ] **LSP regression tests**
  - Test all LSP methods
  - Test error handling
  - Test with various editor states

- [ ] **VSCode extension testing**
  - Syntax highlighting
  - Diagnostics display
  - Code completion
  - Go-to-definition

### 4. **CI/CD Pipeline** (High)

- [ ] **GitHub Actions workflow**
  - Automated test runs on push/PR
  - Multiple platform testing (macOS, Linux)
  - Test result reporting

- [ ] **Performance regression tracking**
  - Benchmark suite in CI
  - Historical performance data
  - Alerts on regressions

- [ ] **Code quality checks**
  - Clippy lints
  - Format checking
  - Documentation coverage

### 5. **Bug Triage & Stability** (Medium)

- [ ] **Known issues audit**
  - Review all TODO/FIXME comments
  - Document known limitations
  - Prioritize fixes

- [ ] **Error message improvement**
  - Review all error messages for clarity
  - Add suggestions for common mistakes
  - Improve error recovery

- [ ] **Edge case hardening**
  - Identify potential panic sites
  - Add proper error handling
  - Fuzz testing for parser

## 🎯 Success Criteria

| Criterion | Target | Measurement |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Test Coverage** | >80% code coverage | `cargo tarpaulin` |
| **Regression Tests** | All major features covered | Test suite passes |
| **CI Pipeline** | Green on all PRs | GitHub Actions |
| **LSP Working** | VSCode extension functional | Manual testing |
| **No Breaking Changes** | All examples still work | End-to-end tests |
| **Performance** | No regression >5% | Benchmark suite |

## 📊 Current State Assessment

### Strengths
- ✅ Core functionality working (proven by Phase 11 completion)
- ✅ Complex examples like ALU compile correctly
- ✅ Multiple backends operational
- ✅ Documentation complete

### Gaps
- ⚠️ **Test coverage is scattered** - need consolidation
- ⚠️ **No golden file regression** - manual verification only
- ⚠️ **No CI/CD** - all testing is manual
- ⚠️ **LSP protocol issues** - noted but not debugged
- ⚠️ **Parser bugs discovered late** - indicates insufficient test coverage

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Large codebase changes could break working features
- **Medium Risk:** Performance regressions might go unnoticed
- **Medium Risk:** New features might break old features
- **Low Risk:** Core functionality is stable
