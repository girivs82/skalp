## âœ… COMPLETION CRITERIA

**This phase is done when:**
- [ ] Can generate gate-level netlist from any MIR design
- [ ] Optimization passes reduce area by at least 20% on benchmarks
- [ ] Timing analysis correctly identifies critical paths
- [ ] Technology mapping works for both ASIC and FPGA targets
- [ ] All optimization passes have comprehensive tests

**Success Test:**
1. Synthesize a 32-bit ALU design
2. Compare area with unoptimized version (should be 20% smaller)
3. Verify timing analysis matches expected critical path
4. Generate both ASIC (standard cell) and FPGA (LUT) mappings

## ðŸ“ˆ PROGRESS

**Daily Log:**
```
[Dec 28, 2024] - Phase 6 started - Setting up LIR crate structure
```

**Blockers:**
- [ ] Need to decide on technology library format
- [ ] Consider integrating with existing tools (Yosys, ABC) vs building from scratch

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL DECISIONS

**LIR Design Philosophy:**
- Keep it simple and gate-level (no high-level constructs)
- Support hierarchical netlists for modularity
- Make optimization passes composable and optional
- Design for both ASIC and FPGA from the start

**Optimization Strategy:**
- Start with simple local optimizations
- Build up to complex global optimizations
- Make each pass independently testable
- Provide detailed optimization reports

**Integration Points:**
- Consider BLIF or structural Verilog as exchange formats
- Support constraint files (SDC for timing)
- Enable integration with place & route tools

**When done, run `/complete-phase` again for Phase 7: Verification**
