# Phase 6: Advanced Features

**Goal:** Implement high-level design abstractions for expressive hardware design

**Duration:** 4 weeks (Weeks 19-22)

**Success Test:** Implement a pipelined design using flow blocks - all tests passing

## âœ… COMPLETION CRITERIA

**This phase is done when:**
- [ ] Match expressions compile to correct SystemVerilog case statements
- [ ] Flow blocks generate proper pipelined hardware
- [ ] Trait system works with generic entities
- [ ] Const generics generate parameterized SystemVerilog
- [ ] Intent annotations are parsed and stored correctly

**Success Test:** Successfully compile a pipelined processor design using flow blocks and trait-based interfaces, with all generated SystemVerilog synthesizing correctly.

## ðŸ§ª KEY TEST CASES

**Test 1: Pattern Matching State Machine**
```skalp
enum State { Idle, Active, Done }

match current_state {
    State::Idle => next_state = State::Active,
    State::Active if ready => next_state = State::Done,
    State::Active => next_state = State::Active,
    State::Done => next_state = State::Idle,
}
```

**Test 2: Flow Block Pipeline**
```skalp
data |> validate |> transform |> output
```

**Test 3: Trait-based Generic Entity**
```skalp
trait BusInterface<const WIDTH: usize> {
    fn transfer(data: nat[WIDTH]) -> bool;
}

entity Processor<T: BusInterface<32>> {
    // Use T for bus operations
}
```

**Test 4: Intent-driven Design**
```skalp
@intent(low_power, high_performance)
entity FastALU {
    // Compiler optimizes based on intent
}
```
