## ðŸ“ˆ PROGRESS

**Daily Log:**
```
[Date] - [What got done] - [Any blockers]
```

**Blockers:**
- [ ] Need access to iCE40 development board for testing
- [ ] Need standard cell library for ASIC flow testing
- [ ] May need to integrate with external EDA tools

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

**Backend Pipeline:**
1. **LIR â†’ Target IR:** Convert from SKALP LIR to target-specific representation
2. **Technology Mapping:** Map to target primitives (LUTs for FPGA, cells for ASIC)
3. **Constraint Application:** Apply timing, power, and area constraints
4. **Optimization:** Target-specific optimizations for performance/area/power
5. **Output Generation:** Generate bitstream (FPGA) or netlist (ASIC)

**Target Support:**
- **FPGA:** iCE40 family with yosys/nextpnr integration
- **ASIC:** Generic standard cell flow with OpenROAD integration
- **Future:** Xilinx, Intel/Altera, advanced ASIC processes
