## Testimonial (Hypothetical User)

> "I'm a SystemVerilog engineer, and I was skeptical about learning another HDL. But the migration guide had me productive in 15 minutes. The quick start worked perfectly, and when I got stuck, the syntax reference had exactly what I needed. The testbench guide is fantastic - way better than dealing with SystemVerilog testbenches. SKALP's documentation is honestly better than most commercial tools I've used."

### Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Fix tutorial series (remove unimplemented features)
2. Add sequential and memory cookbooks
3. Create types and operators references
4. Add tests to real-world examples

### Long Term (Next Month)
1. Set up mdBook for beautiful docs site
2. Add CI for doc testing
3. Create video tutorials
4. Add interactive examples
