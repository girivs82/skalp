# Phase 9: Safety Features Implementation

**Goal:** ISO 26262 compliance features with FMEA generation and safety metrics

**Duration:** 4 weeks (Oct 2 - Oct 30, 2024)

**Success Test:** Generate accurate FMEA for a safety-critical design

## ‚úÖ COMPLETION CRITERIA

**This phase is done when:**
- [ ] Safety requirements can be expressed and validated in SKALP
- [ ] FMEA reports are automatically generated from design intent
- [ ] Safety metrics (SPFM, LFM, PMHF) are calculated accurately
- [ ] Power domain safety mechanisms are functional
- [ ] ISO 26262 compliance features are demonstrated

**Success Test:** Generate accurate FMEA for a automotive safety-critical design (e.g., airbag controller, brake system) with correct failure modes, safety mechanisms, and compliance metrics
