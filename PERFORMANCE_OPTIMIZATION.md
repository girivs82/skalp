## Optimizations Applied

### 1. Compiler Pipeline
```rust
// Before: Sequential processing
let hir = build_hir(source);
let mir = hir_to_mir(hir);
let lir = mir_to_lir(mir);

// After: Streaming with early cleanup
let hir = build_hir(source);
let mir = hir_to_mir_streaming(hir); // hir dropped here
let lir = mir_to_lir_streaming(mir); // mir dropped here
```

### 2. GPU Simulation
```rust
// Before: CPU-GPU sync every cycle
for cycle in 0..num_cycles {
    gpu_compute();
    sync_and_read_results(); // Expensive
}

// After: Batched execution
let batch_size = 1000;
for batch in (0..num_cycles).step_by(batch_size) {
    gpu_compute_batch(batch_size);
    if needs_sync { sync_and_read_results(); }
}
```

### 3. Memory Pools
```rust
// Before: Frequent allocations
fn create_node() -> Box<Node> {
    Box::new(Node::new())
}

// After: Pool-based allocation
struct NodePool {
    nodes: Vec<Node>,
    free_list: Vec<usize>,
}

impl NodePool {
    fn get_node(&mut self) -> &mut Node {
        if let Some(idx) = self.free_list.pop() {
            &mut self.nodes[idx]
        } else {
            self.nodes.push(Node::new());
            self.nodes.last_mut().unwrap()
        }
    }
}
```
